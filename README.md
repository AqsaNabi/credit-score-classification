# Credit Score Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the credit score of individuals (Good, Standard, Poor) based on their financial and socio-economic information. Credit score prediction is a crucial task in the financial sector, as it helps banks and lending institutions evaluate risk before offering loans or credit facilities. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to automate the credit assessment process and improve decision-making accuracy.
